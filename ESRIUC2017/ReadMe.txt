We conduct an in-depth analysis on the tweets posted during ESRI's User Conference 2017. 
The crawled tweets are attached with one of these 3 hashtags -- #esriuc; #esriuc2017; #esriuc17

Posts made on online social media platforms are a wealth of information to extract meaningful patterns about user perceptions, opinions, status of the current affairs, etc. 
Main goal of this analysis is to investigate what users post about UC. This analysis helps learn about the conference along with 
sentiments and emotions expressed by attendees that could help plan the future conferences.
